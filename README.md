# PMR CLI (RS)

Zig rewrite of [jascha030/pmr-cli](https://github.com/jascha030/pmr-cli), which is _a small project management CLI utility, written in PHP to store project management related links._

This is just a personal project to help me learn Zig. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it, but I'll try to keep it up to date with the original project.

I did this before with Rust when building [jascha030/pmr-rs](https://github.com/jascha030/pmr-rs), which was a fun experience, so I'm hoping to have the same experience with Zig.
